My dataset was the “Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition” (Palechor, F. M., & de la Hoz Manotas, A. (2019)).
The goal is to predict obesity levels from the observed attributes.
After data exploration, model testing and parameter optimisation I could obtain a model which can predict the mass body index from lifestyle clue with a r² close to 0.7
